General TODO tasks:
A list of tasks to be done by anyone who needs work to do.
! <-- Indicates high priority task

@Front-End:
    - Put content on Pet help page
    - Make Food and Grooming advice tables side-by-side on desktop, but still vertical on mobile
            - Like how the calendar and reminder tables work. @Rosario maybe you can take a look?


@Back-End:
    - Filters @Ben:
        - ! Allow multiple options in same filter to be selected (i.e. Size is Very Small OR Small)
        - ! Add a button or tickbox on both the dogs and breeds page labelled "Show favourites" that does the following:
                1. Ensures user is logged in (should be as easy as calling enforce_login())
                2. Applies filter "favourite_breeds.userid=get_userid()" if it is ticked/selected
        - Fix text for size filter (Small-Large instead of Low-High)
    - Validate user inputs in login form
    - Validate user inputs in account creation form
    - Maybe start using password hashes? Low priority though
    - Add all filter-3 items in filter-menu.php into one div per category (e.g. filter-3 items under 'Popularity' are in a div)

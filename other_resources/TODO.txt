General TODO tasks:
A list of tasks to be done by anyone who needs work to do.
! <-- Indicates high priority task

@Front-End:
    - ! Fix menu bar position and transparency (keeps appearing on top of things)
    - Make username/login text under account icon look better (especially with longer names)
    - About us page
    - Contact us page

@Back-End:
    - Make favourite button change once clicked
            - This will require checking if the breed is in user's favourites with SQL (assuming user is logged in),
                    and displaying icon or text to match (maybe a heart or empty heart button?)
    - ! Make page (or maybe popup window?) to showcase a dog breed.
            - This should be dynamic in that once the name of breed is clicked on, it shows info for that breed
                    (as opposed to creating a html page for every single breed)
            - Should display additional breed info and ALL the photos linked to that breed_id
    - ! Make page (or maybe popup window?) to showcase a dog needing adoption (copy template from the breed one above).
                  - This should be dynamic in that once the dog name clicked on, it shows info for that dog
                          (as opposed to creating a html page for every single dog)
                  - Should display all info about the dog, maybe some photos of the breed
                  - Should also display all the info for the shelter the dog is at (maybe even a map if time allows?)
    - Create a way to filter the dogs and breeds page
            - Then create a way to apply a filter by default for logged-in users to the breeds they're interested in
    - Validate user inputs in login form
    - Validate user inputs in account creation form
    - Maybe start using password hashes? Low priority though
